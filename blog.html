My name is Patrick Folan and I am currently a technical marketing student at the Startup Institute Boston. This blog will primarily be about my experience at the Startup Institute, but from time to time will probably include other random posts.

The first two weeks at the Startup Institute have certainly been jam packed. The first week was primarily dedicated to orientation and learning the ‘soft skills.’ Many of my fellow classmates and I came to the Startup Institute to learn hard skills. Soft skills, however, are often what can make or break a group project or even a company. Learning how to communicate with others while understanding how others communicate is an essential skill set for those looking to work for start ups. The success of a start up is not only dependent upon a great idea but a great team as well. While I had anticipated diving into the hard skills right away, I definitely benefited from the sessions on soft skills and the discussions we had during them. Understanding communication patterns and team dynamics will continue to serve me on my journey into the start up world.

This week, Week Two, the marketing track began with HTML/CSS. Prior to enrolling in Startup Institute I had taught myself the basics of HTML through code academy. After this week, I realized I had not taught myself as much as I had thought.  Thus the project of building my own personal website has certainly been frustrating.  Despite the challenges of trying to build  my website, the process of trying different pieces of code and seeing what works has been a great learning experience. There is still much for me to learn, but I am looking forward to learning as much as I can. After all, at the Startup Institute you must embrace the #learntodo attitude.

Well that will be it for now, I should probably get back to those SQL tutorials….
