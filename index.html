		<p> I was born and raised in the Boston area, but decided to go away for college at the University of Richmond (Go Spiders!). My work experience is rather varied having held positions ranging from customer service to marketing. Most recently I worked in marketing at a small management consultantcy. I found myself reading more and more about technology and start ups so I decided to pursue opportunities at start ups in the Boston area. In my search I stumbled upon the Startup Institute and the rest is history! </p>
